# wrap-em-up

A basic tool for wrapping classic code blocks in additional code 

## Playground

```
const aJsFunction = () => {
  console.log("I don't like curly brackets")
  # How about another then?
  const moreCurlyBrackets = {
    [bruh is this even valid JS?]: {
      it does not matter :]
    }
  }
}
```
